Template Selection Tool TMac v0.991   Copyright 2004--2008 mhb & qsh. Welcome to use it! This software is freeware!
If you have any questions or comments, please contact me freely.
Basic usage£ºTMac v0.95 provides a new customizable toolbar panel, which is very useful to invoke MTeX utils easily in any applications. You can see a hint message once you put mouse cursor over any tool icon for a while.
If you move mouse to the leftmost tool icon (TMac), I will open previous Templates/Symbols window, and you can select a template or command from the blue combobox, or select a symbol panel from the red combobox and select a symbol from current panel, and it will be sent to the clipboard automatically. 
If you have specified the editor in the command line, then the selected template or command will be sent to the corresponding text editor. 
If you click the first small icon (OPEN) in the tool bar panel, then I will prompt you to choose a file and open it by the default text editor. Note that I will remember the current file path so that other tool icons can use such information. I can pass the current file path to the utils configured in TMac.ini.NOTE: right-click to select from file history.
If you click the second small icon (UtilsMan) in the tool bar panel, then I will invoke Utils Manager, which can smartly popup proper dropdown menu according to the type of current file. In this way, you can easily compile your TeX files or programs without using any complex text editors with tool menus. Thus by this powerful MTeX toolbar panel for all applications, you can even use stupid Notepad to edit and compile your tex files or programs easily by clicking the OPEN icon to open the file and clicking UtilsMan icon to invoke popup menu.
Other icons in the toolbar panel include several distinguished MTeX utils and those utils defined in TMac.ini. If you click the top rightmost small icon (EditIni), file tmac.ini will be opened with mini_pad for your editting. The formats of settings are very simple, and I hope you can add your own templates, symbols or tools by cloning existing settings and making changes:-) 
Please click [OK] to reload the settings after editting the settings.
